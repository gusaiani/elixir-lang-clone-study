defprotocol Enumerable do
  @moduledoc """
  Enumerable protocol used by `Enum` and `Stream` modules.

  When you invoke a function in the `Enum` module, the first argument
  is usually a collection that must implement this protocol.
  For example, the expression:

      Enum.map([1, 2, 3], &(&1 * 2))

  invokes `Enumerable.reduce/3` to perform the reducing
  operation that builds a mapped list by calling the mapping function
  `&(&1 * 2)` on every element in the collection and consuming the
  element with an accumulated list.

  Internally, `Enum.map/2` is implemented as follows:

      def map(enum, fun) do
        reducer = fn x, acc -> {:cont, [fun.(x) | acc]} end
        Enumerable.reduce(enum, {:cont, []}, reducer) |> elem(1) |> :lists.reverse()
      end

  Notice the user-supplied function is wrapped into a `t:reducer/0` function.
  The `t:reducer/0` function must return a tagged tuple after each step,
  as described in the `t:acc/0` type.

  The reason the accumulator requires a tagged tuple is to allow the
  `t:reducer/0` function to communicate the end of enumeration to the underlying
  enumerable, allowing any open resources to be properly closed.
  It also allows suspension of the enumeration, which is useful when
  interleaving between many enumerables is required (as in zip).

  Finally, `Enumerable.reduce/3` will return another tagged tuple,
  as represented by the `t:result/0` type.
  """

  @typedoc """
  The accumulator value for each step.

  It must be a tagged tuple with one of the following "tags":

    * `:cont`    - the enumeration should continue
    * `:halt`    - the enumeration should halt immediately
    * `:suspend` - the enumeration should be suspended immediately

  Depending on the accumulator value, the result returned by
  `Enumerable.reduce/3` will change. Please check the `t:result/0`
  type documentation for more information.

  In case a `t:reducer/0` function returns a `:suspend` accumulator,
  it must be explicitly handled by the caller and never leak.

  @type acc :: {:cont, term} | {:halt, term} | {:suspend, term}

  @typedoc """
  The reducer function.

  Should be called with the enumerable element and the
  accumulator contents.

  Returns the accumulator for the next enumeration step.
  """
  @type reducer :: (term, term -> acc)

  @typedoc """
  The result of the reduce operation.

  It may be *done* when the enumeration is finished by reaching
  its end, or *halted*/*suspended* when the enumeration was halted
  or suspended by the `t:reducer/0` function.

  In case a `t:reducer/0` function returns the `:suspend` accumulator, the
  `:suspended` tuple must be explicitly handled by the caller and
  never leak. In practice, this means regular enumeration functions
  just need to be concerned about `:done` and `:halted` results.

  Furthermore, a `:suspend` call must always be followed by another call,
  eventually halting or continuing until the end.
