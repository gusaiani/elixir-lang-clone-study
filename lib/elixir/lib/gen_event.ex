  # Functions from this module are deprecated in elixir_dispatch.

  @moduledoc """
  A event manager with event handlers behaviour.

  If you are interested in implementing an event manager, please read the
  "Alternatives" section below. If you have to implement an event handler to
  integrate with an existing system, such as Elixir's Logger, please use
  [`:gen_event`](https://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_event.html) instead.

  ## Alternatives

  There are a few suitable alternatives to replace GenEvent. Each of them can be
  the most beneficial based on the use case.
