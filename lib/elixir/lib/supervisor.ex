defmodule Supervisor do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  A behaviour module for implementing supervisors.

  A supervisor is a process which supervises other processes, which we
  refer to as *child processes*. Supervisors are used to build a hierarchical
  process structure called a *supervision tree*. Supervision trees provide
  fault-tolerance and encapsulate how our applications start and shutdown.

  A supervisor implemented using this module has a standard set
  of interface functions and includes functionality for tracing and error
  reporting.

  ## Examples

  In order to define a supervisor, we need to first define a child process
  that will be supervised. As an example, we will define a GenServer that
  represents a stack:

      defmodule Stack do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(state) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, state, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(stack) do
          {:ok, stack}
        end

        def handle_call(:pop, _from, [h | t]) do
          {:reply, h, t}
        end

        def handle_cast({:push, h}, t) do
          {:noreply, [h | t]}
        end
      end

  The stack is a small wrapper around lists. It allows us to put
  an element on the top of the stack, by prepending to the list,
  and to get the top of the stack by pattern matching.

  We can now start a supervisor that will start and supervise our
  stack process as follows:

      # Start the supervisor with the stack as a single child.
      #
      # The first element of the tuple is the module containing
      # the child implementation, the second is the argument
      # given to start_link, in this case a stack with `:hello`.
      {:ok, pid} = Supervisor.start_link([
        {Stack, [:hello]}
      ], strategy: :one_for_one)

      # After started, we can query the supervisor for information
      Supervisor.count_children(pid)
      #=> %{active: 1, specs: 1, supervisors: 0, workers: 1}

  Notice that when starting the GenServer, we are registering it
  with name `Stack`, which allows us to call it directly and get
  what is on the stack:

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> :hello

      GenServer.cast(Stack, {:push, :world})
      #=> :ok

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> :world

  However, there is a bug in our stack server. If we call `:pop` and
  the stack is empty, it is going to crash because no clause matches:

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      ** (exit) exited in: GenServer.call(Stack, :pop, 5000)

  Luckily, since the server is being supervised by a supervisor, the
  supervisor will automatically start a new one, with the initial stack
  of `[:hello]`:

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> :hello
